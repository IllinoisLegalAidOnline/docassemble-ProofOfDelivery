  Proof of delivery
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Proof of delivery** Easy Form.

  This program will help you prepare forms to prove that you sent a copy of a court document to the other parties in a court case.
  
  You must send a copy of the document to the other parties in the court case anytime:

  * You file a document with the court, or
  * The judge sends or gives a court order only to you.
field: sees_nav_bar
---
id: instructions
continue button field: how_to_use
question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need: 

  * Names and addresses of the other parties, 
  * Names and addresses of the other parties’ lawyers, and 
  * The court case number. 

  You can find this information on other court papers you have about this case. 

  Set aside 5 to 10 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some questions have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that also gives help.

id: in re check
question: |
 Does the court case have the words "**In re:**" in the name?
subquestion: |
  Look at the name of the case at the top of the court papers. "In re" is often used in probate, guardianship, and some family law cases. For example, a probate case regarding Jane Doe's estate might be called "In re: Estate of Jane Doe."
  
  **Note:** If the court papers say "In re:" but also list the names of people in the case, you can select **No**. For example, if the case title is "In re: Marriage of Julia Smith and Tony Smith," the names you already entered will be put on your forms.

  If you started the case, the court clerk should have given you the case number.
  
  In this example, the case number is **2022 EXAMPLE 123**.
